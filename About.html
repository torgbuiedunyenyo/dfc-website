<p>
  Originally founded in 2018, the Dream part of our name came from our idea of an artist’s role in dreaming into or foreshadowing new worlds and possibility; the Farm from our desire to stay grounded and productive; the Commons signifies our desire for this space to be larger than our individual practices and to be a site for gathering.  
    <br> <br>
   In 2026, Dream Farm Commons entered a new era of shared leadership. Sharing curation, artistic production and programming are; Ann Schnake, Charlotte Law, Ebti, Glenna Cole Allee, Jeremy Kirshbaum, Judit Navratil and Meghana Bisineer.  
    <br> <br>
    Located on the unceded homelands of the Ohlone people, Dream Farm Commons aims to support the survivors of the american empire across time and place, and knows we are deeply entangled in its ongoing damage.
