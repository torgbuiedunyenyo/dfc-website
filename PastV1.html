<br><br>
Ariel Cooper is a multidisciplinary artist working through visual storytelling and social/ecological/material interventions. In her work she connects personal shatterings and mendings to collective and historical events and processes. This manifests as experimental narrative comic books and tapestries populated by animal and spiritual critters, haunting visitations, landscapes, psychological domestic interiors and playful expressions of nonlinear time. As well as through experiments in open-source landscape art projects like the Sausal Creek Artist Collaborative, all of which seek to work in opposition to the alienation processes inherent in the capitalist project.<br><br>Ariel Cooper lives and works in Oakland, CA; the unceded homelands of the Ohlone people. She lives in the Fruitvale neighborhood along the Sausal Creek Watershed that drains into the San Francisco Bay.  <br><br>
