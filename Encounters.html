<h5>ENCOUNTERS between and within<br>Susan Wolf & Tracy Grubbs</h5>
<p>Opening Reception: September 6, 4:00-6:00 (Artist talk 5:00pm)<br>
Closing Reception: September 27, 4:00-6:00 with whispered text and readings</p>

<p>Dream Farm Commons and its associated Annex Space open the fall season with Encounters, two shows that meditate on the embedded nature of our existence with other species and with language. Encounters emerge from an unexpected or casual meeting with something or someone; revealing the other story, the untold one, the story that changes how we move through the world.</p>

<p>Tracy Grubbs' paintings, drawings and sculptures explore themes of interconnection and impermanence, often focusing on the liminal space between self and other. Drawn to the provisional yet functional architecture of natural structures like bird nests and bee hives, as well as forms made by human hands, her show at Dream Farm Commons sits at the intersection of human and non-human modes of thinking and making. Using references from art history, natural history and anthropology, the work meditates on the interconnected relationship between human and non-human species and our capacity to build embedded rather than isolated futures.</p>

<p>Susan Wolf will be in the Annex with Slowly Moving With a Burden Bent, a participatory performance. The artist's body carries conversational prompts in an exaggerated backpack, stops to rest, using the Annex as a home to document changes over time while inviting others to join in a graceful dialogue held by three gestures: Tearing, Twisting and Anchoring a length of fiber to text. The emergent poetic response begins with conversations and the materials for cross stitching text onto canvas sacks. Each text sleeve becomes a carrier of meaning and curiosity, enabling relationships while crafting stories. Over time, the gestures and encounters held by the fibers result in a collective word poem. At the end of the residency the materials will be carefully deconstructed and untangled to be read aloud, printed and passed along. Finally, fragments and pieces are reloaded into the backpack and slowly carried away until a future time and place.</p>

<p>Both artists draw upon the eco-feminist writings of Ursula LeGuin and Donna Haraway to inform their work. In the words of Donna Haraway: It matters what stories we tell to tell other stories with; it matters what concepts we think to think other concepts with. ... Le Guin's stories are capacious bags for collecting, carrying and telling the stuff of living. A leaf a gourd a shell a net bag a sling a sack a bottle a pot a box a container. A holder. A recipient.</p>

<p>Gallery Space will be open from 1:00 to 6:00 on Saturdays in September.</p>
